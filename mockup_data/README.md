### This folder contain script to generate sample data according to the following rules:

## Script
_1. Create sets of entity references:_
```    
for type in entity types:
# eventually we might want to create 100s if not 100s of references;
# I started working with ~5 so I can more easily check what's happening
create and name <num> references
```
_2. Create agent/user pool:_
```
create and name <num> agents
```
_3. Create activities:_
```
while n < <desired number of activities>:
  # depending on the cardinality rules for each activity type, this function
  # will randomly select references from the sets defined above; the 
  # function will also assign the activity a unique ID and format the result
  # as a nested list (which can be easily converted to JSON)
  create_activity(type = <activity type>, 
                  used = <allowed 'used' refs>, 
                  generated = <allowed 'generated' refs>, 
                  agents = <agents pool>)
```                  
**Note:** the logic for sample size specified here shouldn't be hardcoded, but either some sort of map or function to lookup numbers based on activity type:

```
  n_used_refs <- 1
  n_generated_refs <- 1
  n_agents <- 1
```
There might be other checks and considerations I've missed...

_4. Combine activities:_

We might eventually want to get all activities into a more tabular format so we can save as CSV, but I think we can stick with an array of JSON objects for now.

**Note:** Output is written directly into console with JSON format.

## Usage
To run the program you need to type in the command line: 
```
>> python main.py 
```
Program will generate output in json structures for Agents (5 records), References (10 records) and Activities (30 records).

## Program hard-coded parameters
```
#numer of agents generated by script
#can be changed in the **main.py** file
NUMAGENTS = 5

#numer of references generated by script
#can be changed in the **main.py** file
NUMREFERENCES = 10

#numer of activities generated by script
#can be changed in the **main.py** file
NUMACTIVITIES = 30

#array of Agent roles
#can be changed in the **agent.py** file
roles = ["Role_1", "Role_2", "Role_3", "Role_4", "Role_5"]

#array of Reference roles
#can be changed in the **reference.py** file
roles = ["data", "tool", "state", "message", "report"]

#array of Activities types
#can be changed in the **activity.py** file
actArray = ["Tool session", "Mention", "Report generation"] 
``` 

## Sample output
