# Provenance Service
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sage-Bionetworks/prov-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Sage-Bionetworks/prov-service) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Sage-Bionetworks/prov-service/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/Sage-Bionetworks/prov-service?branch=master&service=github)

Lightweight implementation of the Synapse Activity services, based on the PROV spec.

## Overview

This is an OpenAPI-enabled (and documented) Flask server. This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask. The [py2neo]() driver library for Python is used to manage operations between RESTful API requests/responses and a Neo4j database.

## Requirements

Python 3.5.2+

You should have access to a local installation of Neo4j, serving at `bolt://localhost/7687`.

You'll also need to set two environment variables based on your Neo4j configuration (the Flask app uses these to connect to the database):

```shell
export NEO4J_USERNAME=<username>
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=<password>
```

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt .
```

To start the app, you can use this command:
```shell
synprov
```

### Neo4j browser

If you have the **Neo4j Desktop** application installed, you should be able to view and explore the graph database using Cypher queries. For example, to view all nodes and relationships:

```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n
```

### Swagger UI

You can also interact with the graph database through RESTful API queries. The service provides a Swagger UI endpoint to test requests through the browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/rest/ui/
```

The OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/rest/openapi.json
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

> **Note:** In order to use the server container, which requires a MongoDB database connection, you should have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) installed.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

After running this command, the URLs in the previous section should work.

## Development

To add changes locally, install the package in developer mode:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
```

## OpenAPI Generator

This server was originally generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

Starting with the Synapse Activity API specification in a `swagger.yaml`, the contents of this repo were generated with the following command:

```
npx openapi-generator generate -i swagger.yaml -g python-flask -DpackageName=synprov -o prov-service/
```
